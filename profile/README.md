# Welcome to the Survon Project!

Survon is an offline, off-grid survival system designed to operate in challenging scenarios where reliability, modularity, and adaptability are crucial. At its core, Survon puts humanity and freedom first, fostering societal resilience and safeguarding knowledge to ensure essential tools and technology remain accessible even in the face of systemic disruptions. In a world increasingly dependent on fragile systems, Survon is a practical response to challenges like energy crises, communication breakdowns, or resource scarcity. It equips individuals and communities to adapt, innovate, and thrive. Our mission is to create a robust ecosystem that empowers users to maintain and expand their systems without requiring technical expertise.

## What is Survon?

### For Nerds:
Survon is a modular, offline-first framework designed to ensure resiliency and adaptability in uncertain times. It employs:
- **Rust** for its core runtimes, offering safety, performance, and low resource consumption.
- **Dynamic Module System** to enable plug-and-play functionality, with validation and isolation to prevent interference.
- **Hardware Integration** to support low-power devices like Raspberry Pi and other ARM-based systems.
- **Future-Proof Communication** methods, including BLE, radio, and 5G mesh networking for post-grid scenarios.

The architecture emphasizes decentralization, open standards, and the ability to sync modules and updates securely even in resource-constrained environments.

### For Survivalists:
Survon is designed to integrate seamlessly with whatever systems you already have in place. Its modular approach allows you to:
- **Interface with Hardware**: Control solar arrays, monitor battery levels, and integrate sensors.
- **DIY Repair and Maintenance**: Full support for 3D printing parts, schematics, and hardware interfacing ensures self-sufficiency.
- **Expand on Demand**: Add modules for monitoring, communication, agriculture, and more to fit your unique survival setup.

It’s more than software; it’s a complete system to support your preparedness.

### For the Hopeless:
Survon is here for everyone, even those who feel overwhelmed by the complexity of preparedness. We are working toward providing pre-assembled builds and bundles, available at the cost of materials and labor. However, we strongly encourage you to take the DIY approach. With basic parts sourced from places like Adafruit or Amazon, you can get started immediately and learn along the way. Don’t wait for pre-built solutions—if you have even a glimpse of resilience in you, start now and empower yourself with the tools to survive.

## Repository Structure

The Survon ecosystem consists of core runtimes, field runtimes, and modular components contributed by the community. Below is an overview of the repositories:

### 2. **`runtime-field-rust`**

This repository contains the **field runtime**, which is a lightweight, portable system designed for use in off-grid scenarios. It focuses on:

- Running compiled Survon binaries.
- Executing modules efficiently in resource-constrained environments.
- Providing a user-friendly interface for offline use.

#### Features:

- Precompiled static binary for maximum reliability.
- Minimal resource usage for portability (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
- Plug-and-play updates from the core runtime.

#### Use Cases:

- Field-ready devices for real-world survival scenarios.
- Portable systems that don’t require Internet connectivity.

### 3. **Community Modules**

Modules are the heart of the Survon system. Each module adds specific functionality, such as communication, monitoring, or computation, ensuring adaptability in a wide range of scenarios, including post-disaster environments. Modules follow a strict packaging standard to ensure compatibility and security.

#### Module Categories and Prefixes

Modules are categorized to maintain consistency and clarity. Each category has a unique prefix used in module naming:

- **Communication (****`com`****)**: Modules for communication systems.
  - Example: `mod-rust-com--morse-code`, `mod-rust-com--irc`
- **Monitoring (****`mon`****)**: Modules for monitoring systems and sensors.
  - Example: `mod-rust-mon--temperature-sensor`, `mod-rust-mon--camera-feed`
- **Defense (****`def`****)**: Modules for defensive systems.
  - Example: `mod-rust-def--manual-turret`, `mod-rust-def--motion-turret`
- **Power (****`pow`****)**: Modules for managing power systems.
  - Example: `mod-rust-pow--solar-array`, `mod-rust-pow--battery-monitor`
- **Weather (****`wth`****)**: Modules for weather tracking and forecasting.
  - Example: `mod-rust-wth--storm-alert`, `mod-rust-wth--rain-gauge`
- **Library (****`lib`****)**: Knowledge and computational modules.
  - Example: `mod-rust-lib--pubmed-library`, `mod-rust-lib--math-utils`
